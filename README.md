# Semiconductor Workshop RGBD Dataset

This dataset contains RGBD images for 3D reconstruction of scenes in a semiconductor workshop. The dataset is modeled using **Blender** and generated using **BlenderProc**. The format of the dataset is based on the structure of the [Neural RGB-D dataset](https://github.com/dazinovic/neural-rgbd-surface-reconstruction), and it includes various data types for depth and RGB images, along with ground truth poses for camera calibration and optimization.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset follows the following directory structure:
